After running the tests, the Connection: Keep Alive client version ran faster with the fastest time being 
1668 seconds whereas the fastest time for the Connection: Close client was 2926 seconds. All of the times
belonging to the Connection: Keep Alive client were faster than 2926 seconds as well. Thus, using Keep Alive
saw improved response time. Some of the reasons are the reduction of time as a result of less number of times
needing to set up a TCP connection request each time data needs to 
be sent over the server. The current connection can be leveraged to continue to request and send data for multiple
instances. Also, the latency is reduced by avoiding any overhead caused by a three-way handshake needed for new connections.
